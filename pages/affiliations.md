### Canadian Women Composers Archive Collection

Selected materials related to _‘slippages'_ as exhibited on this website are part of UBC Library’s Canadian Women Composers Archive Collection (CWCAC).

The CWCAC is a unique music resource serving to:  
* document the compositional practices of Canadian women composers active at home and abroad;
* support future musicologists, music theorists, ethnomusicologists, and music performers interested in music analyses;
* and, expand participating composers’ audiences.

The collection was established in 2015 and is housed at University of British Columbia (UBC) Library’s Rare Books and Special Collections (RBSC) on UBC’s Vancouver campus. It includes a variety of items, such as hand-edited scores, original manuscripts, working drafts, photographs, prints, published articles, correspondence, streaming videos, as well as miscellanea used for inspiration in the artists’ process. Each year, the UBC Music Librarian working together with UBC Rare Books and Special Collections (RBSC) collaborates with a Canadian composer for purposes of acquiring research resources appropriate to the CWCAC.

The list of current CWCAC participants is available through [canadian-women-composers-collection.pdf](http://rbscarchives.library.ubc.ca/downloads/canadian-women-composers-collection.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

The CWCAC is made possible through generous funding from the Anne Kaplan Endowment, UBC Library.
